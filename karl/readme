Before the workshop I created simple scripts to help others to get started.
They provide some reference inline and crossline display so evertyone can
make comparisons at the same locations.

There are madagascar and su scripts.  They assume the segy files of the 
field and gathers are in the fetch directory.  Read comments at top of
fetch/fetch.job.

To run su scripts:
cd fetch
./fetch.job
cd ../basic.su
basic.job

to redisplay results:
display.job

To run madagascar scripts:
cd fetch
scons view
cd ../basic-mad
scons view
