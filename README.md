# SEG_3D_SPWW_2015
SEG 3D Seismic Processing Working Workshop Houston 2015- Land 3D
SEG Open Seismic Processing Working Workshop - Land 3D, August 19-22, 2015
This working workshop aims to get some computational effort going towards Land 3D processing.
1. At this point the repository is a placeholder to hold the code from the different partipant groups. 
2. Each group will create a directory/folder under PAI-SEG/SEG_3D_SPWW_2015 and store their code there.
3. User should be aware that Git is a distributed version control system and allows for greater flexibility but this also means that it is a
good idea to spend a few minutes planning your strategy before you start cloning/coding etc.
4. The basic premise is that you clone the https://www.github.com/PAI-SEG/SEG_3D_SPWW_2015 repository into your local Git repository.
5. Once you have the code in your local repository than you can code different scenarios and test your results etc.
6. Once you are ready to check in then you merge the code back into the GitHub repository https://www.github.com/PAI-SEG/SEG_3D_SPWW_2015.
